  * Delegate embedded JavaScript to the appropriate (partial) parser.

Recognize more stuff
--------------------
  * parenthesised expressions, e.g. `f=(->)`, `(class C)`
  * assignments in code parameters, e.g. `foo(f = ->)`
  * assignments in closures, e.g. `(-> globals.f = ->)()`
  * assignments in objects, e.g. `x = {f: ->}`

Rewrite AST walker / add a "Scope Mode"
---------------------------------------
  * Track scope (i.e. all assignments & parameters) and build tree
    accordingly.
  * Resolve dotted names and allow for "phantom nodes" in the tree,
    e.g. `exports.f = ->`
  * Recognize prototype construction:
      - prototype assignments to a previously defined function / class
      - `this.x` assignments in methods
  * Allow to switch between modes: "Scope", "Source", "Source+Docco".

Tricky stuff
------------
  * class' `extends` values (which are expressions).
